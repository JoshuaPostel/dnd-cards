You should note that since 1994 LaTeX2e provides a new font selection scheme
called NFSS2 with several new, combinable font commands. KOMA-Script
classes had defined the old font commands like `\it' only for compatibility
with old LaTeX 2.09 document styles of Script 2.0. Nevertheless, these
commands are deprecated and undocumented at least since 2003. Since 2013
KOMA-Script classes warned about soon removement of these deprecated commands.
Now, after two decades of LaTeX2e and NFSS2, these commands will not work any
more. If loading a package results in this error message, you should contact
the author of that package and ask him to replace the deprecated font command
`\it', e.g., by `\normalfont \itshape `. Otherwise you should reconfigure
or replace the package. If you have used the old font command `\it' yourself,
you should replace it, e.g., by `\normalfont \itshape '.
To make it work for now, you can use the already also deprecated class option
`enabledeprecatedfontcommands'.

Dimensions can be in units of em, ex, in, pt, pc,
cm, mm, dd, cc, nd, nc, bp, or sp; but yours is a new one!
I'll assume that you meant to say pt, for printer's points.
To recover gracefully from this error, it's best to
delete the erroneous units; e.g., type `2' to delete
two letters. (See Chapter 27 of The TeXbook.)

You should note that since 1994 LaTeX2e provides a new font selection scheme
called NFSS2 with several new, combinable font commands. KOMA-Script
classes had defined the old font commands like `\bf' only for compatibility
with old LaTeX 2.09 document styles of Script 2.0. Nevertheless, these
commands are deprecated and undocumented at least since 2003. Since 2013
KOMA-Script classes warned about soon removement of these deprecated commands.
Now, after two decades of LaTeX2e and NFSS2, these commands will not work any
more. If loading a package results in this error message, you should contact
the author of that package and ask him to replace the deprecated font command
`\bf', e.g., by `\normalfont \bfseries `. Otherwise you should reconfigure
or replace the package. If you have used the old font command `\bf' yourself,
you should replace it, e.g., by `\normalfont \bfseries '.
To make it work for now, you can use the already also deprecated class option
`enabledeprecatedfontcommands'.

You should note that since 1994 LaTeX2e provides a new font selection scheme
called NFSS2 with several new, combinable font commands. KOMA-Script
classes had defined the old font commands like `\it' only for compatibility
with old LaTeX 2.09 document styles of Script 2.0. Nevertheless, these
commands are deprecated and undocumented at least since 2003. Since 2013
KOMA-Script classes warned about soon removement of these deprecated commands.
Now, after two decades of LaTeX2e and NFSS2, these commands will not work any
more. If loading a package results in this error message, you should contact
the author of that package and ask him to replace the deprecated font command
`\it', e.g., by `\normalfont \itshape `. Otherwise you should reconfigure
or replace the package. If you have used the old font command `\it' yourself,
you should replace it, e.g., by `\normalfont \itshape '.
To make it work for now, you can use the already also deprecated class option

You should note that since 1994 LaTeX2e provides a new font selection scheme
called NFSS2 with several new, combinable font commands. KOMA-Script
classes had defined the old font commands like `\bf' only for compatibility
with old LaTeX 2.09 document styles of Script 2.0. Nevertheless, these
commands are deprecated and undocumented at least since 2003. Since 2013
KOMA-Script classes warned about soon removement of these deprecated commands.
Now, after two decades of LaTeX2e and NFSS2, these commands will not work any
more. If loading a package results in this error message, you should contact
the author of that package and ask him to replace the deprecated font command
`\bf', e.g., by `\normalfont \bfseries `. Otherwise you should reconfigure
or replace the package. If you have used the old font command `\bf' yourself,
you should replace it, e.g., by `\normalfont \bfseries '.
To make it work for now, you can use the already also deprecated class option
`enabledeprecatedfontcommands'.

You should note that since 1994 LaTeX2e provides a new font selection scheme
called NFSS2 with several new, combinable font commands. KOMA-Script
classes had defined the old font commands like `\it' only for compatibility
with old LaTeX 2.09 document styles of Script 2.0. Nevertheless, these
commands are deprecated and undocumented at least since 2003. Since 2013
KOMA-Script classes warned about soon removement of these deprecated commands.
Now, after two decades of LaTeX2e and NFSS2, these commands will not work any
more. If loading a package results in this error message, you should contact
the author of that package and ask him to replace the deprecated font command
`\it', e.g., by `\normalfont \itshape `. Otherwise you should reconfigure
or replace the package. If you have used the old font command `\it' yourself,
you should replace it, e.g., by `\normalfont \itshape '.
To make it work for now, you can use the already also deprecated class option

You should note that since 1994 LaTeX2e provides a new font selection scheme
called NFSS2 with several new, combinable font commands. KOMA-Script
classes had defined the old font commands like `\it' only for compatibility
with old LaTeX 2.09 document styles of Script 2.0. Nevertheless, these
commands are deprecated and undocumented at least since 2003. Since 2013
KOMA-Script classes warned about soon removement of these deprecated commands.
Now, after two decades of LaTeX2e and NFSS2, these commands will not work any
more. If loading a package results in this error message, you should contact
the author of that package and ask him to replace the deprecated font command
`\it', e.g., by `\normalfont \itshape `. Otherwise you should reconfigure
or replace the package. If you have used the old font command `\it' yourself,
you should replace it, e.g., by `\normalfont \itshape '.
To make it work for now, you can use the already also deprecated class option
`enabledeprecatedfontcommands'.
